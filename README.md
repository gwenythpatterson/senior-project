Personality Based Roommate Pairing Python Program

This python program was created for my Senior Project at Richmond American University London for a BSc in Computer Science 

It allows student answers to be inputted and paired with their perfect roommate / flatmates based on their personality and living preferences *this program was made with a specific set of questions in mind, but can be changed depending on needs*

This was created to make the Student Affairs member in charge of pairing flatmates job significantly easier. 

Due to time constraints this program is in Python and not yet integrated into a website. 

Thanks :)
